issues to fix

1 - qibla locater is still broken and doesn't ask for permissions at all. when clicking enable dynamic, the arrow doesn;t move at all even when the phone is moved. (seen on ios, but could affect android). not sure why this isnt working when it worked fine on web version. do i need to update something on apple connect?
2 - in REMAINING-WORK.md, we need to complete android configuration (#### Android Native Configuration), so complete everything we need to do before i push to play store (like app assets). 
3 - double check app notifications for prayers are working. im still not seeing them on my end. ensure it works for android and iphone. if there is a way for me to test it without wiating for prayer time, provide it for me.
